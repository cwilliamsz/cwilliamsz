### Hi 👋, 
I'm Charles, I'm a software developer 👨‍💻 focused on mobile apps for iOS and iPadOS, I published my first app on the App Store in early 2017. 
I like to develop because I see ideas come to life. 
In my spare time I like to walk my dog 🐶, go to the gym 💪, travel 🌎, listen to music 🎧 and watch movies 🍿.
